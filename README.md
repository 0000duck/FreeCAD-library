FreeCAD-library
===============

This repository contains a library of Parts to be used by FreeCAD. 
These parts are freely available to download, and are meant to be later integrated into a
better Parts management system inside FreeCAD itself.

If you are interested in contributing to this library, please ask for write access to this repository
on this FreeCAD forum thread: https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/free-cad/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=4205

Each Part should be correctly named, and placed into subdirectories by family or type. They should also
be available in both .FcStd and .stp formats, and optionally in .stl format (because github lets you
visualize them). They should also be as simple as possible, and parametric
so users can easily change their dimensions.

All Parts in this repository are licensed under CC-BY http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/
Each Part is copyrighted by and should be attributed to its respective author(s).
See commit details to find the authors of each Part.
