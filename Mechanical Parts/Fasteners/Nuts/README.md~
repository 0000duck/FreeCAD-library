FreeCAD-library/Mechanical Parts/Fasteners/Nuts
===============================================

This repository contains a library of nuts to be used by FreeCAD.

In most CAD systems, screw threads are never modelled because rendering many threaded screws would be too CPU intensive and would serve no purpose. These parts are intended to be used in assemblies and as such their holes are represented as cylindrical, with the nominal screw size as their outer diameter.

Fully modelled threaded nuts may be uploaded into this repository but should have "_fully-threaded" appended to their filename.

The "Metric" folder contains metric nuts while the "Unified" folder contains nuts based on the [Unified Thread Standard (UTS)] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Thread_Standard).
